\begin{abstract}
	This package allows typesetting pseudocode in \LaTeX. It is based on \texttt{algpseudocode} from the \texttt{algorithmicx} package and uses the same syntax, but adds several new features and improvements. Notable features include customizable indent guide lines and the ability to draw boxes around parts of the code for highlighting differences. This package also has better support for long code lines spanning several lines and improved comments.
